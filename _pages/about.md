I am a FINESST fellow and PhD candidate in Astrophysics at the University of Colorado Boulder. I study convection in the Sun, other stars and giant planets. My current research is on the properties of fully compressible internally heated convection. I will be extending this work to consider the effects of rotating convection on giant convection cells in the Sun. You can find an overview of my research under the research tab, and my CV under the CV tab.
